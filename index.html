				<h1>13 Optical Illusions and Visual Tricks.</h1>
					<p>
						At any given moment our visual cortex is processing colour, motion, orientation, and more. It’s a highly advanced system—but it isn’t perfect. It has certain biases. Enter optical illusions. Our vision makes assumption based on learning, memory and expectation, the result is  reality is not always what it seems.</p>
						<p>Take a look at the examples below and see if you can spot the tricks.

							<h1> About</h1>
							<p>I built this page as a final project for General Assembly’s 10 week Front-End Web Development Course. I used Sublime Text as the editor for writing the HTML and CSS. I used JQuery to create my modal pop-ups. It’s hosted on GitHub and version controlled using GitHub and I created the illustrations in Adobe Illustrator and in pure CSS.
							<p>Why choose cognitive illusions? Because I’m fascinated by visual perception and our unconscious assumptions about the world. Also, it’s fun to trick our own brains sometimes.</p>
							<p>I hope this webpage delighted you. If it did, please share it using the links below. </p>
