					<h1>13 Illusions and Visual Tricks</h1>
						<p>
							At any given moment our visual cortex is processing colour, motion, orientation, and more. It’s a highly advanced system—but it isn’t perfect. It has certain biases. Enter cognitive illusions. Our vision makes assumption based on learning, memory and expectation, the result is reality is not always what it seems.</p>
							<p>Take a look at the examples below and see if you can spot the tricks.

							<h1> About</h1>
							<p>I built this page as a final project for General Assembly’s 10 week Front-End Web Development Course. I used Sublime Text, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,GitHub, Adobe Illustrator and Abobe Photoshop to create it.</p>
							<p>Why choose cognitive illusions? Because I’m fascinated by visual perception and our unconscious assumptions about the world. Also, it’s fun to trick our own brains sometimes.</p>
							<p>I hope this webpage delighted you. If it did, please share it using the links below. </p>
