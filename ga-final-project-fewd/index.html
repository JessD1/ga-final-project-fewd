					<h1>13 Illusions and Visual Tricks</h1>
						<p>
							At any given moment our visual cortex is processing colour, motion, orientation, and more. It’s a highly advanced system—but it isn’t perfect. It has certain biases. Enter cognitive illusions. Our vision makes assumption based on learning, memory and expectation, the result is that reality is not always what it seems.</p>
							<p>Take a look at the examples below and see if you can spot the tricks.

							<p>I built this page as a final project for General Assembly’s 10 week Front-End Web Development course. I used Sublime Text, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, Adobe Illustrator and Abobe Photoshop to create it.</p>
							<p>Why choose cognitive illusions? Because I’m fascinated by visual perception and our unconscious assumptions about the world. Also, it’s fun to trick our own brains sometimes.</p>

						<h1 class= "modal-content-heading">Can you see the grey blobs at the intersections of the grid?</h1>
						<p class= "modal-content-para">This is known as the Hermann Grid. This works because of cells in our eyes called the retinal ganglion cells and their inhibition function. When you look at a part of the grid where no lines intersect, less light hits the inhibitory part of these cells. This results in the light pink area looking brighter.</p>

						<p class = "modal-content-para">If you look at the parts of the grid where the light pink lines intersect, there is more light pink relative to black, this means more inhibition occurs and you see a darker pink, or grey colour.</p>

								<p class="modal-content-para">It is a simple wire-frame drawing of a cube with no visual cues as to its orientation. In the case of this cube, you could interpret either the upper left (A) or the lower-right(B) square as its front side.</p>

						<p class = "modal-content-para">The central circle surrounded by large circles appears smaller than the central circle surrounded by small circles.

						<p class = "modal-content-para">The left hand end of the figure appears to be a three pronged fork, but at the right end there appear to be only two. </p>

						<p class = "modal-content-para">Cognitive scientists have been interested in the processes involved in continuing to see impossible figures as possible even when we know them to be impossible.

						<p class= "modal-content-para">The golden section, or golden ration is a common mathematical ratio found in nature that can be used to create pleasing, natural looking compositions in design work.</p>

						<p class = "modal-content-para">The ration exists when a line is divided into two parts and the longer part (a) divided by the smaller part (b) is equal to the sum of (a) + (b) divided by (a), which both equal 1.618.</p>

						<p class = "modal-content-para">The gradient on the left appears darker than the gradient on the right. In fact, the gradients are exactly the same.</p>

						<p class = "modal-content-para">Why? Because of something called lateral inhibition. 
						In neurobiology, lateral inhibition is the capacity for an excited neuron to reduce the activity of its neighbours. The result is darker areas falsely appear even darker and lighter areas falsely appear even lighter.</p>

						<p class= "modal-content-para">Being mathematically precise doesn’t always provide visual or perceptual balance. The overshoot of a round or pointed letter (like O or A) is the degree to which it extends higher or lower than a comparably sized "flat" letter (like X or H), to achieve an optical effect of being the same size; it compensates for inaccuracies in human visual perception.</p>

						<p class = "modal-content-para">In this example the circle and the triangle have been scaled up slightly to compensate for the fact that they have less visual mass than the square.</p>

						<p class = "modal-content-para">This results in part of the circle and triangle protruding above the guideline. Not aligning them exactly with the square, makes for a more balanced composition. </p>

						<p class = "modal-content-para">Placing a triangle within a curved or straight container can make the element appear optically out of place. The reason for this is due to an effect known as the triangle-bisection illusion.</p>
